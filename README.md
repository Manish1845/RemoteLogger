**RemoteLogger** is an Android library ðŸ“± used to log anything/crashes in a file. 

# Usage
1. Setting up library to your App

Add below to your project level 'build.gradle' file.
```
        allprojects {
            repositories {
                maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
            }
        }
```
Add library to your app level 'build.gradle' file.
```
        implementation 'com.github.iambaljeet:RemoteLogger:1.0'
```

2. First setup RemoteLogger in your Application class
```
        RemoteLoggerBuilder()
            .setApplication(this)
            .setLogFileNamePrefix("userId_")
            .setCrashLogsEnabled(true)
            .build()
```

Logging crash: CrashLogging is optional and can be disabled by passing 'false' in 'setCrashLogsEnabled(false)' method.
Adding prefix to file: There is an optional parameter to add prefix to Log file using 'setLogFileNamePrefix("prefix_)' method.

3. Now simply Log anything you want using some generic methods available in RemoteLogger.
```
        RemoteLogger.e(TAG, "This is a error log")
        RemoteLogger.d(TAG, "This is a debug log")
        RemoteLogger.i(TAG, "This is a info log")
        RemoteLogger.v(TAG, "This is a verbose log")
```

Also, you can pass a throwable to any of the Log as an optional parameter
```
        RemoteLogger.e(TAG, "This is a error log", throwable)
```
